# LQR controller for Autonomous Ground Vehicle

The project implements a LQR based controller for longitudnal and lateral control of an Autonomous Ground Vehicle and tries to minimize the tracking error while maximizing operation speed of the vehicle.
It is a state feedback controller that outputs the the steering angle and force.
